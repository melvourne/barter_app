## Project Plan and Estimation
As long as I have something to be submitted by the deadline :(

## Gems and Tools
Devise - user authorisation
Paperclip - image uploading

Heaps!!!
Used sqlite3 instead of postgresql in development
Spent enormous time trying to get braintree working but gave up

## Future features hopefully!
